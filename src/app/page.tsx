/**
 * Landing funnel, top to bottom:
 *   Hero (who) → Quote (the belief) →
 *   Companies (client roster) → Stats (the numbers) — one credibility block →
 *   Paths (#which-path — pick a lane: workshops vs corporate; the hero's
 *   only CTA scrolls here) →
 *   Workshops open (the individual lane's concrete next step) →
 *   Specializations → Testimonials → Gallery → Footer.
 *
 * Reordered 2026-09-06 on client feedback. Specializations used to sit between
 * the roster and the fork, which pushed the page's only decision point below
 * three full sections of background. Proof (logos + figures) now runs straight
 * into the fork, so a visitor reaches "which of these is me" early; the deeper
 * capability material sits after it for anyone still reading.
